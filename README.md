# Sorting Algorithms (Holberton School)

## Overview
This directory consists of files that contains scripts written in C and includes Sorting Algorithms.
### [0. Bubble sort](./0-bubble_sort.c)
* Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.



### [1. Insertion sort](./1-insertion_sort_list.c)
* Builds the final sorted array by inserting elements into the correct position.



### [2. Selection sort](./2-selection_sort.c)
* Divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted part, repeatedly selects the smallest or largest element from the unsorted part, and moves it to the sorted part.



### [3. Quick sort](./3-quick_sort.c)
* Divides the array into smaller sub-arrays based on a pivot element, then recursively sorts these sub-arrays.


### [sort.h](./sort.h)
*

To use our functions you just need to include our header file "sort.h":
